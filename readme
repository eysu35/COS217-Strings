------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was definitely helpful in learning about multi file programs as well 
as string manipulation. It was fun but tricky to debug. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

I am not aware of any bugs in my submission.

What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

strp.c: line 93: low priority:
This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

This warning required me to restructure my entire search function, but
since the function is performing well, I did not think that it would be
beneficial to my learning to address it. I understand that for the 
future, writing clean code without too much nesting of loops and if
statements is optimal. I will definitely keep this stylistic tip in 
mind going forward in the course.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

In this assignment, it is dangerous to use the memory we assume is empty
during Str_copy and Str_concat. However, I do not think it is possible to 
assert that the destination memory is large enough. Even if we iterated
our pointer into those places in memory, we are not sure if other pointers
are pointing there regardless if those memory spots have values stored. 
However, if we use the memory allocation tools (calloc, malloc, realloc) 
that we recently learned about in lecture, we could avoid this problem
in the future and safely check if the memory we are copying/
concatenating to is large enough.
